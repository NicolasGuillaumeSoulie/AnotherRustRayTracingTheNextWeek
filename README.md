# Ray Tracing the Next Week

This is a follow up to my previous project [Another Rust Ray Tracing in One Week(end)](https://github.com/NicolasGuillaumeSoulie/AnotherRustRayTracingInOneWeekend.git) where I followed [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley)'s [first book](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) on ray tracing using Rust. 
In this project, I will continue my ray tracer based on [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley)'s [second book (Ray Tracing the Next Week)](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

## Resources

As I said, this is my implementation of [Peter Shirley](https://github.com/petershirley)'s guide to ray tracing. So of course I followed his book, but I also relied on previous Rust implementations:

- [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) (first of [three books](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io)) 
- [Ray Tracing the Next Week](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) (second of [three books](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io))
